# Generic form builder

You like, use it.  And stuff.

Instead of the normal one.

I dunno shut up go away stop asking questions.

## Subclassing

This is a "generic" form builder because it covers most cases and is a starting point for domain specific form needs.

If there's something missing that you think might be relevant to the wider world by all means put in a pull request,
otherwise subclass the generic builder with your own domain specific additions.
